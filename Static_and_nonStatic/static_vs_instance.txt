->Instance variable

    // Belongs to each object separately.

    // Always starts at 0 for every new object.

    // So each new object’s instanceCount will be 1 after constructor runs.

    // it store in heap arer


->staticCount

    // Belongs to the class.

    // One single copy is shared among all objects.

    // Every time a new object is created, the same staticCount is increased.

    // it store in memory area


->output of this code

    // Instance Count: 1 | Static Count: 1
    // Instance Count: 1 | Static Count: 2
    // Instance Count: 1 | Static Count: 3


->Instance Methods:

    ->Belong to an object (instance) of a class.

    ->Can access both:

        ->Instance variables

        ->Static variables

    ->Need an object to call them (cannot be called without an object unless you call from inside the same class in a non-static way).

    ->Have access to this keyword (because they work with an object).

->Static Methods

    Belong to the class, not to an object.

    Can only directly access:

    Static variables

    Other static methods

    Cannot directly access instance variables or instance methods (need an object for that).

    Cannot use this keyword (no object is associated).

    Called using the class name (though objects can call them, it’s not recommended).
