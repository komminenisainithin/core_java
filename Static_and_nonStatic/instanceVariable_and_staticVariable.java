//instance variable

// Belongs to each object separately.

// Always starts at 0 for every new object.

// So each new objectâ€™s instanceCount will be 1 after constructor runs.

// it store in heap arer


// staticCount

// Belongs to the class.

// One single copy is shared among all objects.

// Every time a new object is created, the same staticCount is increased.

// it store in memory area


// output of this code

// Instance Count: 1 | Static Count: 1
// Instance Count: 1 | Static Count: 2
// Instance Count: 1 | Static Count: 3
